This is JavaScript, HTML and CSS project website made my Mann Bajpai.
Here we play the Simon Game in which there are 4 tiles of 4 different colours,
viz, blue, green, red, yellow. The key is to remember the pattern of the tiles
and select them accordingly. With a further level the score also increases.
This project is inspired from AppBrewery London course on Udemy.


Can You Beat The Highscore???
